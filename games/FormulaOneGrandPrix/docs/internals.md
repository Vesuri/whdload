# Internals

## Slave

Codetapper's v1.0 (06.12.2002), 5464 bytes, no source. Header (slave offsets):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `ws_Version` | 15 |
| `ws_Flags` | `$3402`: NoError, EmulPriv, ClearMem, Examine |
| `ws_BaseMemSize` | `$80000` (512 KB chip) |
| `ws_ExpMem` | `$C0000` (768 KB, includes the 256 KB Kickstart 1.3 image) |
| `ws_GameLoader` / `ws_CurrentDir` | `$170` / `data` |
| `ws_keyexit` | `$59` (F10) |

It is a KickEmu-style OS slave on Kickstart 1.3 (`kick34005.A500` + `.RTB`). The loader at
`$174`: creates the `F1GP_Disk_#1..4` assigns, sets preferences (fast pointer), turns the
audio filter off, then

1. unless `CUSTOM1` is set or fire is held, `LoadSeg`s and runs `frontend`, which is only
   the credits intro ending at "Click to Load Main Program";
2. `LoadSeg`s `f1gp`, accepts file sizes 582992, 582988 or 582780 (one patch list each,
   at `$2A6`, `$2DC`, `$312`), `resload_PatchSeg`s it, patches the built-in driver names
   (`$3D6`), and runs it with an empty argument line; on return, quits.

The patch lists are not decoded yet.

## Executables

`data/game` is the original hard-disk loader (assigns, `frontend`, then `f1gp`); the slave
does not use it.

| File | Hunks (memory) |
|---|---|
| `f1gp` (582992 bytes) | 0 code `$44A54` any, file `$2C`; 1 BSS `$2A940` any; 2 code `$41C70` chip, file `$4990C`; 3 BSS `$14F84` chip |
| `frontend` (127816 bytes) | 0 code `$8` any; 1 BSS `$6F790` any; 2 code `$1EC04` chip, file `$60`; 3 BSS `$2FC58` chip |

`f1gp` holds the language dialog, the manual-protection prompt, the startup and main menus,
the race and the results screens (all their strings are in it, for example "Quick Race" at
hunk 2 `$3D8F0`). Menus and race therefore share one executable and need no handover.

## Route to gameplay

From boot (`WHD_ARGS=CUSTOM1=1` skips the intro; otherwise click at its prompt): Choose
Language → O.K.; manual protection → any key, Return (the slave accepts anything); Startup
Menu → Quick Race, O.K.; Silverstone track screen → O.K.; "Please Wait" while the race
loads. The race then runs with no input. It opens in the player's cockpit ("Riding with
Nigel Mansell", car 5, fourth on the grid) at the start lights; the player's car only
creeps (5–16 mph) and drops to 26th while the field drives away. A "Viewing" sequence and
a follow-car camera follow until "Race won by …"; the game then returns to the
Non Championship Results menu.
