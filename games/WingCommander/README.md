# Wing Commander

Project scaffold for fixing the Amiga OCS disk and CD32 versions through their
WHDLoad installs. Original slaves: Psygore, version 1.0. Source is unavailable.

**Phase 4 in progress: cache audits and scoped 020 measurements are verified.**
Both 020 cache states pass profiler-neutrality controls; source-change counts and
converter/limiter instruction costs are recorded. Accelerated timing coverage,
general caller attribution, DMA/idle accounting and ceiling experiments remain open.
Phase 3 completed the reproducible intro and publication counter.
Two fresh boots match all 31 milestone screenshots, live game hunks and the
reset-to-menu event ledger. Full traces and independent SWAP_ONLY counts agree.
Stop at the phase 4 gate; phase 5 is not authorised.
The original and reconstructed slaves match at the menu and pilot-name prompt
for Custom5=0–3. Phase 2 is complete.
Phase 1 static findings are documented. Runtime timing and display hypotheses
remain hypotheses except for the scoped runtime findings recorded in the internals.

See [open work](docs/open-work.md), [development](docs/development.md) and
[known internals](docs/internals.md). Agent rules are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

```sh
make fetch
make verify
make prepare

```

The installer and both full installs are pinned in `manifest/inputs.tsv`.
Archives and separate extracted originals live under ignored `tmp/`.
The shared development tools come from AmigaXDev's installed environment.
