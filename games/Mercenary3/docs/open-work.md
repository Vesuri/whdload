# Current work

Goal: improve the game's performance, especially on higher-end Amigas (a 68020 with
fast RAM and above): frame rates up to 50 fps with smooth movement and rotation of the
player and other objects, while world simulation and game logic keep their native rates.

The shipped slave is reconstructed byte for byte. A reproducible 500-field `a1200-fast`
profile of a walk out of the cell exists, with a validated frame counter, a main-loop cost
split and the measured game-time model ([internals](internals.md)).

## Findings that shape the work

- World ticks per frame are the elapsed fields clamped to 4..8. The world runs in real
  time only between 6.25 and 12.5 fps; above 12.5 fps the original runs fast.
- Per-frame logic outside the tick loop, and the collision test that undoes a whole pass's
  movement, run once per main loop pass. Running passes at the render rate would change
  game behaviour even with one tick per field, so the pass rate must stay native.
- World logic costs about 1% of a frame on `a1200-fast`; drawing about 1.4 million cycles
  (5 fields). Decoupling alone therefore removes the speed-up, not the drawing cost: higher
  frame rates also need faster drawing (faster CPUs, code and CPU-only data out of chip RAM,
  renderer work).
- The slave's `_dmaon` waits for a vertical blank on every frame (14.7% of the CPU time)
  and leaves 12 of the frame's 34 copied bytes uncopied. The performance slave's `Custom1`
  bit 0 fixes both: 7.40 to 8.98 fps on `a1200-fast`, same build.
- All game code and data are in chip RAM, even with fast RAM fitted. On `a1200-fast`, 80%
  of the CPU's chip accesses are code fetches (50%), CPU-only data (21%) and the stack
  (7%); only the display buffers (20%) need chip RAM. The instruction cache hits about 43%
  of fetched longwords; 95% of the misses come from 18.5 KB of code.
- Measured on `a1200-fast`, one build, `Custom1=1` as the reference (8.93 fps): 64-bit
  bitplane fetch (bit 1) 9.45 fps, the stack in fast RAM (bit 2) 9.49, both 9.62. The A500
  is unchanged by both (FMODE is AGA-only; its slow RAM is chip-bus memory).
- The publication waits for the next field after each `COP1LC` write (7-10% of the CPU's
  time on `a1200-fast`): double buffering quantises frames to whole fields.
- No blitter, no misaligned longwords, the panel is not redrawn, interrupts cost 1.6%.

## Design: native logic passes, separate presentation frames

1. **Logic passes stay native.** Run the unchanged main loop pass (per-frame logic, n
   ticks, collision test) only when at least 4 fields have passed since the previous pass,
   with n = clamp(elapsed, 4, 8) as now. On a fast machine the world then advances exactly
   as on a native machine at 12.5 fps: one tick per field, input sampled per pass, the same
   collision granularity. Slower than 4 fields per frame, nothing changes.
2. **Presentation frames in between.** When fewer than 4 fields have passed, draw and
   publish only: stage presented poses into the renderer's inputs, run the drawing calls,
   then restore the committed state. Nothing in a presentation frame writes world state.
3. **Presented poses**, with alpha = fields since the last pass / the pass length:
   - the player is extrapolated from the native per-tick rates (walking 6 units, turning
     2 heading units per tick with the input held): no added delay; it can overshoot when
     the player stops, turns back or collides, and snaps back to committed state then;
   - other objects are interpolated between the last two committed passes: never an
     uncommitted pose, one pass (80 ms) of display delay.
   Snap at teleports, transport changes, lifts and new objects.
4. **Publication**: at most one frame per field, as now (the game waits for the VERTB
   counter after each `COP1LC` write, which caps it at 50 fps PAL). `_dmaon`'s per-frame
   wait goes, with the copy restored.
5. Everything behind a `CUSTOMn` option; with it off, the original bytes.

## Decisions

- The player's presented pose is extrapolated from the native per-tick rates; other
  objects are interpolated between the last two committed passes (the user's choice).
- On fast machines logic passes run at the minimum native pass length, 4 fields (12.5 Hz).

## A1 blocker

Input verification and the byte-identical original build pass. A1 remains unchecked:
changing its route anchor cannot supply the missing 68030 MMU instruction trace required
by `route_profile.py`. Bounded boot probes have not yet established gameplay or isolated
the missed breakpoint to cache/MMU behaviour. The evidence and limits are in
[internals](internals.md#a1-anchor-investigation); the prerequisite is recorded in the
plan. No game behaviour or slave code changed, and no new performance figure is available.

## Next steps

The ordered, step-by-step plan with step IDs is [plan.md](plan.md).
