# Internals

Addresses are offsets in `Disk.1` unless marked as slave patch-list offsets. The game
image loads to a fixed chip address, so the slave's absolute addresses map to `Disk.1`
by one constant (below).

## Slave

`Mercenary3.Slave` (1,148 bytes, Harry, Graham and Wepl, version 1.2, 29.07.2004) is
identical in the full install and the official installer. The installer's
`src/Mercenary3.slave.asm` is an earlier state of its source: the shipped slave also
has the `PL_W $716` and `PL_P $A858` patches below, a `_waitvb` subroutine where the
source expands the `waitvb` macro inline, and the build date. `src/Mercenary3.islave.asm`
is the RawDIC imager.

`whdload/original/Mercenary3.slave.asm` is the reconstruction: the installer source
with those additions and with Barfly's optimised encodings written out (`moveq`, short
branches, PC-relative `lea`, `cmpi` and an `abs.w` operand). vasm `-no-opt` rebuilds the
shipped slave byte for byte (`make original`).

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ws_Version` | 10 |
| `ws_Flags` | `NoError`, `Disk`, `EmulTrap` |
| `ws_BaseMemSize` | `$80000` (512 KB, all chip) |
| `ws_ExpMem` | 0 |
| KickEmu | none: a direct (no-OS) game |
| `ws_keyexit` | raw `$41` (Backspace; the source comment says F10). Raw `$78` also quits |
| Options | none |

Boot sequence in `_boot`:

1. `resload_DiskLoad` `Disk.1` `$0..$7D80` to chip `$4000`: a title picture whose
   palette and four planes are shown for one second (`resload_Delay 50`).
2. Clear chip `$100..$80000`, then load `Disk.1` `$9000..$767B0` to chip `$5350`.
   A chip address `A` in the game image is therefore `Disk.1` offset `A + $3CB0`.
3. Point four game variables at the slave's keyboard bytes (chip `$8`/`$9`). On a 68040
   or later only, rewrite eight code locations to use vectors at chip `$C0..$CC`.
4. If the word at `Disk.1` `$5DE60` is `jsr abs.l` (`$4EB9`), this is the copy-protected
   version and the slave replaces the call with three `moveq #0,d0`. The supplied install
   is that version.
5. `resload_Patch` with base `$50000`, `resload_SetCACR` with the instruction cache on,
   then jump to `Disk.1` `$4EDB0` with SR `$2700`.

Patch list (offsets relative to `$50000`; add `$53CB0` for the `Disk.1` offset):

| Offset | Patch | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$716` | `PL_W $8200` | the operand of the game's `move.w #$8380,dmacon`: enable master DMA only, without copper and bitplanes |
| `$1E30` | `PL_S 8` | skip a ROM access |
| `$205A` | `PL_P _subd0` | replace an empty `dbf` delay with a raster-line wait |
| `$29A6`, `$29BC`, `$29C6` | `PL_P _patch_aud1` | AUD1 interrupt exits: poll the keyboard, acknowledge, `rte` |
| `$2AC0`, `$2C9E` | `PL_P _patch_vertb` | VERTB interrupt exits: the same |
| `$5E8A` | `PL_P _loadgame` | load `Mercenary3.saveN` from the install directory |
| `$5F26` | `PL_P _savegame` | save `$2056` bytes from chip `$5550` |
| `$A858` | `PL_P _dmaon` | enable copper and bitplane DMA after a vertical blank, then copy six bytes and return |

`$A858` lies inside an unrolled `move.l (a1)+,(a0)+` copy that continues to `$A862`.
From that entry the original copies 18 bytes and `_dmaon` copies six. Which callers
enter there, and whether the difference matters, is not yet checked.

The slave installs its own level-2 handler at `$68` for the keyboard. Its keyboard
poll (`_checkkeyboard`) busy-waits three raster lines for the handshake and stores the
key code at chip `$8`, with `$FF` at `$9`.

## Running

On the A500-equivalent machine the title picture is followed directly by gameplay:
the prison cell on Metis, with the on-screen clock running from `00-00-00` and the
chief prison officer's scripted messages. No attract demo has been seen. Traces from
the native build record PCs, in the game image and in the slave in slow RAM.

No code layout beyond the slave's view, timing model or performance measurement has
been established.
